# TinxHttpd

@[baixiangcpp]

TinxHttpd is a simple HTTP server."Tin" means "Tiny", "inx"  means “Nginx", hahaha :), it is just a joke .
I wrote a HTTP server at the begining of this year. Due to I did not commit it to my github.It was missing after my Windows reinstalled. This version is a improved one.But it also has some bugs and shortages. Also it will be constantly improving.

## Usage

compile this code with user 'root' becuse TinxHttpd runs as a set-userid program.
